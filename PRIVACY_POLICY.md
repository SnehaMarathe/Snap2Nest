# Privacy Policy — SnapNest

Effective date: 2026-01-06

SnapNest is an on-device photo collage app.

## Data collection
SnapNest **does not collect, store, or transmit** your personal data to any server controlled by us.

## Photos and media
When you choose photos from your gallery or take a photo with the camera, those photos are processed **on your device** to create collages.

SnapNest saves exported collages to your device storage (e.g., your Pictures folder) only when you choose to export.

## Permissions
SnapNest may request access to:

- **Camera** — to capture photos for a collage.
- **Media picker / photos** — to let you choose images from your device.

These permissions are used only to provide app functionality.

## Third-party services
SnapNest does not include analytics SDKs, ad networks, or third-party tracking in this build.

## Children’s privacy
SnapNest is not designed to collect data from children. Since we do not collect personal data, there is no special handling required.

## Changes to this policy
If the app’s data practices change, this policy will be updated and the effective date will be revised.

## Contact
If you have questions about this policy, contact the developer via the email address listed on the Google Play Store listing.
